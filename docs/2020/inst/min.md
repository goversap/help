# Minimal installation requirements for Gover

!!! Note
    The minimal requirement for Gover is any SAP system with GAP Gateway (software component SAP_GWFND).

Gover frontend part requires SAP Gateway with SAP UI5 library at least version: 1.48.9 (UI software component in version: SAP_UI 752 SP00 (or above Support Package). For systems that do not offer UI5 in the recommended version, Gover can still run from [Technical launchpad](../ui5lib-options.md).

Gover works in both HUB and Embedded deployments.

Here is the list of compatible SAP releases Gover is compatible with:

|1610|1709|1809|1909|2020|
