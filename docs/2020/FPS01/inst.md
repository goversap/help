## Evaluation deployment

If you are installing Fiori Apps' Usage for the first time, please check [Evaluation deployment](eval-dep.md) for details on installing it to one system (f.e. Sandbox).

!!! Note
    We designed each Fiori Apps' Usage Report product to work independently. Once you install the product and any dependent products are needed, it will guide the user to install those.

## Products compatibility

!!! Note
    Release 2020 FPS01 is not downward compatible with previous releases. It should **not** be installed on top of older releases. If you have used previous releases and would like to move to release 2020 FPS01 then you need to move your data manually. If you need help with moving you data please contact our project manager for an offer (gm@nypesap.com)
